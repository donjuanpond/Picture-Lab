# Picture-Lab
Picture lab done in AP CS A along with Juju Zhao in May - June 2023.

The actual code we wrote is inside the `Picture` class. Testing that code happened in the `_SOLUTION` class.
Our job was to do a few things with picture manipulation in Java, including making all green, red, and blue versions of an image, overlaying various images to make a composite, and performing grayscale and color-shift operations.
The biggest part of this project was our implementation of a diagonal mirroring of an image, regardless of its dimensions. Although this project was pretty simple, it was still fun to do.
